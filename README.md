## Hello, I am Santy!

I began my career in India and my work allowed me to experience living in New Zealand, Australia and now the USA.  

I am an interested in software architecture, programming and hacking - hardware, electronics and espresso machines. I am an avid HAM Radio operator (KF5KGI). 

My current interests include machine learning, blockchain and security.

I am a minimalist and spend quite a lot of energy balancing simplicity and functionality.
