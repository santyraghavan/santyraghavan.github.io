It is now Januany 23 2019. 10.47 AM CST. The DSN site (NASA Deep Space Now) is reporting that it is receiving signals from VGR2. Voyager2!!
The signals travelled approximately 18 Billion Kilometers before reaching Canberra, Australia where it is currently being detected. 
18 Billion Kilometers or a neat 1.3 day roundrip for a speedy photon. Data is currently being read at a pricely rate of 159 bits per second.

DSN is reporting the received power fron VGR2 at -153.61 dBm!

If this is not a feat of human engineering, I don't know what is.
