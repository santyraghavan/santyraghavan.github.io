Q
You have been engaged by a company to design and lead a migration to an AWS environment. 
The team is concerned about the capabilities of the new environment, especially when it 
comes to avoiding bottlenecks. The design calls for about 20 instances (C3.2xLarge) pulling
jobs/messages from SQS. Network traffic per instance is estimated to be around 500 Mbps at 
the beginning and end of each job. Which network configuration should you plan on deploying?
A
When considering network traffic, you need to understand the difference between storage traffic
and general network traffic, and the ways to address each. The 10Gbps is a red-herring, in that
the 500Mbps only occurs for short intervals, and therefore your sustained throughput is not 
10Gpbs. Whereever possible, use simple solutions such as spreading the load out rather than 
expensive high tech solutions.

Q
You have created a bespoke VPC that contains 2 web servers. These web servers must be publicly accessible by the internet and should also be highly resilient. Which of the following configurations should you consider? (Choose 2)\

An Elastic Load Balancer can help you deliver stateful services, but not stateless. Elastic Map Reduce is a data crunching services and is not related to servicing web traffic.
