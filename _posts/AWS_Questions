Q
You have been engaged by a company to design and lead a migration to an AWS environment. 
The team is concerned about the capabilities of the new environment, especially when it 
comes to avoiding bottlenecks. The design calls for about 20 instances (C3.2xLarge) pulling
jobs/messages from SQS. Network traffic per instance is estimated to be around 500 Mbps at 
the beginning and end of each job. Which network configuration should you plan on deploying?
A
When considering network traffic, you need to understand the difference between storage traffic
and general network traffic, and the ways to address each. The 10Gbps is a red-herring, in that
the 500Mbps only occurs for short intervals, and therefore your sustained throughput is not 
10Gpbs. Whereever possible, use simple solutions such as spreading the load out rather than 
expensive high tech solutions.

Q
You have created a bespoke VPC that contains 2 web servers. These web servers must be publicly accessible by the internet and should also be highly resilient. Which of the following configurations should you consider? (Choose 2)\

An Elastic Load Balancer can help you deliver stateful services, but not stateless. Elastic Map Reduce is a data crunching services and is not related to servicing web traffic.

AWS does not copy launch permissions, user-defined tags, or Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI.

With proper scripting and scaling policies, the On-demand instances behind the Spot instances will deliver the most cost-effective solution because the on-demand will only spin up if the spot instances are not available. DynamoDB is a regional service, there is no need to explicitly create a multi-AZ deployment. RDS could be used, but DynamoDB lends itself better to supporting stateless web/app installations.

Network throughput is the obvious bottleneck. You are not told in this question whether the proxy server is in a public or private subnet, so if it is in a public subnet, the the proxy server instance size itself is not large enough to cope with the current network throughput. If the proxy server is in a private subnet, then it must be using a NAT gateway in which to communicate out to the internet. This NAT gateway may also be inadequately provisioned in terms of size. You should therefore increase the size of both the proxy server and the NAT gateway.

The tenancy of an instance can only be change between variants of â€˜dedicated' tenancy hosting. It cannot be changed from or to default tenancy hosting.
